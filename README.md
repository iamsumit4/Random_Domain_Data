# Random_Domain_Data

A simple repository to generate and manage random domain-name data for testing, analysis, or other domain-data use cases.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project contains scripts and tools to generate **random domain names** or handle **domain-related data**. Possible use cases include:

- Generating synthetic domain-name lists for testing DNS systems, web crawlers, or domain filtering rules.  
- Simulating domain traffic data (analytics, logs) without relying on live domains.  
- Experimenting with domain name parsing, patterns, or machine-learning features on domains.  
- Providing sample data for educational or demonstration purposes.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
Random_Domain_Data/
├── code/                ← Directory for scripts (MATLAB, Shell, etc.)  
├── .DS_Store            ← macOS system file (can be ignored)  
└── README.md            ← This file  
```

- `code/` contains the main scripts used to generate or process domain-data.  
- `.DS_Store` is a system file created by macOS and is not part of the project logic.  

---

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB (version compatible with the scripts in the `code/` folder).  
- Unix-based shell (macOS or Linux) if running any shell scripts.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamsumit4/Random_Domain_Data.git
   cd Random_Domain_Data
   ```

2. Navigate to the `code/` directory:  
   ```bash
   cd code
   ```

3. Run the main script (example in MATLAB):  
   ```matlab
   % Example command — adjust based on actual script name
   run generate_random_domains.m
   ```

4. The script will generate a list or file of random domain names for analysis.

## ✅ Features / Highlights

- Generates realistic-looking but synthetic domain names.  
- Flexible structure, allowing you to add features such as custom TLDs, subdomains, and varied lengths.  
- Minimal dependencies — mainly MATLAB and optional shell scripts.  
- Lightweight and easy-to-understand repository structure.

---

## 🔧 How to Extend or Customize

- Add new TLDs or modify domain syntax rules in the generator script.  
- Include subdomain generation (e.g., `api.example.com`).  
- Export output in CSV, JSON, or other formats for analytics or ML workflows.  
- Integrate into simulations, e.g., generating domain access logs.
